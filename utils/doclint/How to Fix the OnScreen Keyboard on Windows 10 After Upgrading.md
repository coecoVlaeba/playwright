# How to Fix the On-Screen Keyboard on Windows 10 After Upgrading
 
The on-screen keyboard (OSK) is a useful feature on Windows 10 that allows you to type on a virtual keyboard using your mouse, touchpad, or touchscreen. It can be handy if you have a physical keyboard that is not working properly, or if you need to switch between different languages and character sets.

However, some users have reported that the OSK stopped working or became unresponsive after upgrading to Windows 10. This can be frustrating and inconvenient, especially if you rely on the OSK for your daily tasks. Fortunately, there are some ways to fix the OSK on Windows 10 and get it working again. Here are some of the most common solutions:
 
## 1. Update Your System
 
One of the first things you should do if you encounter any problems with the OSK is to check if your system is up to date. Microsoft regularly releases updates to fix security issues, install new features, or patch known problems. So if you've missed the chance to update to the latest Windows version, you might run into all sorts of problems, including the OSK malfunctioning.
 
To check if your system is up to date, go to **Start**, then select **Settings** > **System** > **About**. If you're not using the latest Windows version, you can schedule Windows to update so it doesn't interrupt your current activities.
 
## 2. Launch the On-Screen Keyboard via Settings
 
If you're experiencing issues when trying to launch the OSK using the **Win + Ctrl + O** keyboard shortcut or clicking it from the taskbar, let's try and launch the keyboard from Windows settings. Here's how:
 
- Right-click the **Start** button and select **Settings**.
- Go to **Ease of Access** > **Keyboard**.
- Turn on the toggle below **Use the On-Screen Keyboard**.
- A keyboard that can be used to move around the screen and enter text will appear on the screen. The keyboard will remain on the screen until you close it.

Note: To open the OSK from the sign-in screen, select the Accessibility button in the lower-right corner of the sign-in screen, and then select On-Screen Keyboard[^1^].
 
## 3. Check Windows Services
 
Windows uses the Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Panel service to ensure the functionality of the OSK. So if the service stopped running, you'll notice issues when trying to use the virtual keyboard. Here is how you can check this service:

- Press **Win + R** to launch a Run dialog.
- Type `services.msc` and press Enter.
- From the Services list, open Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Panel.
- Make sure the service is running. Set Startup type to Automatic or Automatic (Delayed Start).
- Click Save > OK to save your new settings.
- Restart your computer and check if the OSK is now working.

## 4. Run an SFC Scan
 
If a corrupt system file is causing the OSK problem, running the System File Checker should fix the problem. Start by launching Command Prompt with administrative rights. Then, type `sfc /scannow` and press Enter to launch the scan[^2^]. The scan will take some time to complete, so be patient and don't interrupt it. Once it's done, restart your computer and see if the OSK works as expected.
 
## 5. Troubleshoot Your Touchscreen
 
If you're using a touchscreen device and the OSK is not responding to your touch inputs, you might need to troubleshoot your touchscreen. There are several possible causes for a touchscreen malfunction, such as driver issues, calibration errors, or hardware damage. Here are some steps you can take to fix
